# Solution of Assignment-2
This repository contains the solution for the Syntheaâ„¢ Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) model and synthetic data set. I had to use this dataset to solve a few given problems.  I had to reorganize the data, merge the data into a single data frame, and create a scatter plot that contrasted the COVID-19 patients who survived with those who died.  Moreover, I utilized the `folium`  Python library to display the locations of the remaining patients as well as the COVID patients on the map.
